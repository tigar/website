I write code for algorithmic art, iterate on game design, draw, paint, bake lots of bread, and rock climb. Always happy to chat about music, new recipes, art (no AI art), hiking/climbing spots, or whatever else.

I spent the fall after college at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), an educational retreat for programmers in Brooklyn, NY, that I cannot recommend enough for anyone and everyone who considers themselves a programmer.

I currently work from home at [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com) as a Full Stack Search & SEO engineer in Oakland, CA.
